# Project_Management_Tool
Project management tools are essential for efficiently planning, executing, and monitoring projects. They help teams collaborate, stay organized, and meet project goals and deadlines. The choice of a project management tool can significantly impact a project's success. 
This tool helps the users to assign work to other members and I have taken Student, Faculty and Admin as users.
